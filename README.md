## Project Overview

This project was built as part of a Full-Stack Technical Assessment.

The objective was to design and implement a secure, type-safe task management dashboard where:

. Users can register and log in securely

. All backend endpoints require authentication

. Users can manage (create, read, update, delete) their own tasks

. he entire stack is strictly typed using TypeScript

. he UI is responsive, modern, and production-ready
